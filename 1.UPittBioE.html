Segmentation of venous vasculature tree was done using semi-automated region growing implemented in MIPAV. Voxels within a vessel were identified and thresholding was done interactively, and restricted regionally, to track vessels across slices. Demonstration of tracking vessels across slices using 3D isotropic images is possible and more realistic than 2D images with higher inplane resolution. Neighbourhood based segmentation algorithms would produce realistic segmentation using isotropic images when compared to non isotropic 2D acquisition which could be biased in high resolution dimension</td>

                        <td>Abstract: To evaluate the effect of different cylindrical and close-conforming receive-only array designs on spin excitation and specific absorption rate (SAR) of a 7T transmit-only head coil. Materials and Methods: We developed finite difference time domain (FDTD) models of different receive-only array geometries. Cylindrical and close-fitting helmet arrays with varying copper trace widths, a TEM Tx coil model, and two head models were used in numerical simulations. Tx coil coupling was experimentally measured and validated with FDTD modeling. Results: Changing copper trace width of loops in array models caused subtle changes in radio frequency (RF) absorption (<5%). Changes in SAR distribution were observed in the head models with Rx-only inserts. Peak SAR increased (-.1 to +15%) in different tissues for a mean B1+ in the brain of 2 mT. Total absorption in the head models for 1W forward power increased (5% to 21%) in the heads with Rx-only inserts. Changes in RF absorption with different Rx inserts indicate a change in RF radiation of the Tx coil even when changes in B and coupling between ports of Tx coil were minimal. Conclusion: Changes in local/global SAR and subtle changes in B1+ field distributions were observed in the presence of Rx-only inserts. Thus, incorporation of the receive-only array effects are needed when evaluating SAR and designing RF transmit pulse waveform parameters for shimming and/or Tx-SENSE for 7T MRI.</td>
