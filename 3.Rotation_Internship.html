                            <p>UNIX socket programming of wireless ARM Sharp PDA. I tested the implementation of the <a href="https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/webpages/faculty/manos/files/mobnets/papers_site/papers/clustering2.pdf"> adhoc-clustering</a> algorithm, developed at University of Pittsburgh.</p>
                            <p>During the summer rotation I wrote a simple client-server application in Linux (sockets) that used the underlying adhoc-routing infrastructure, to transmit messages between the PDA's. Also wrote up the specifications document for an alert system, that tracked users in a building to come up with speedy evacuation notification system during an emergencies. I came up with the idea to build it on a publisher-subscriber design pattern similar to how users subscribe to in a chat applications</p>
