            <hr>
            <p>
            Held weekly recitations and assisted professors with undergraduate and graduate ECE classes viz.
            Circuits Design,
            Signals and Systems, Digital and Analog Communication and Filter Design, Stochastic Processes, and Discrete Signal Processing.

                        Smart antennas with MIMO architecture will be the defacto technology for future broadband wireless access networks, this is apparent from its incorporation into the current wireless standards.
                        My preliminary work is in trying to understand the requirements of a MIMO aware MAC, for different PHY architecture, and identify mechanisms that would ultimately address QoS issues of service differentiation based on throughput and delay for Smart antenna based wireless LAN devices</td>
